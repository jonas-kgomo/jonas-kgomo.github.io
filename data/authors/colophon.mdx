  <div>
    I designed and built this site myself. Everything is open source and published on
    <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> if you'd like to poke around. The whole thing is frankly
    overengineered for a personal website, but playing with transient web technologies is an indulgent
    hobby I don't want to relinquish. I started building it in late 2021 and tinker on it regularly.

  <b>Technologies & Techniques</b>
  <div>
    <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> does most of the heavy lifting – it's a static site
    builder that takes care of a lot of otherwise cumbersome optimisations like server-side
    rendering, image loading, and routing.
  </div>
  <div>
    I used <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and{' '}
    <a href="https://styled-components.com/">styled components</a> to build and design the
    interface. All the individual notes and essays are written in{' '}
    <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a> – a souped-up version of markdown that makes it easy to
    design and reuse custom components and interactive JavaScript elements.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> takes care of hosting. Animations are built with{' '}
    <a href="https://www.framer.com/api/motion/">Framer Motion</a>.
  </div>

  <div>
    I know other people prefer setups where they can click one button and push content from personal
    notes to the web. I personally like having more control over how the material is displayed and
    laid out. Working directly in the native medium of the web – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – gives
    me fine-grained control. It allows me to play with typography, illustrations, graphic design,
    videos, animations, and interactive elements that pure text pipelines can't support. Text isn't
    the only way to represent ideas.
  </div>
  <b>Typography</b>
  <div>
    Headers are set in <a href="https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/canela">Canela Display</a> and
    body copy is set in <a href="https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/canela">Canela Text</a>, both
    from <a href="https://commercialtype.com/">Commercial Type</a>. I love its semi-serifs and
    classical feel. Supporting sans-serif type is set in{' '}
    <a href="https://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/">Lato</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    I use a <a href="https://utopia.fyi/">fluid type scale</a> developed by{' '}
    <a href="https://utopia.fyi/">Utopia</a>, which uses some wild CSS calculations to continuously
    adjust the font size relative to your browser's width.
