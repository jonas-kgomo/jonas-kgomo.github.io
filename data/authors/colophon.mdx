 <p>A colophon is a nobby designer word for 'how this site was made'</p>
<p>I designed and built this site myself. Everything is open source and published on 
<a href="https://github.com">Github</a> if you'd like to poke around. The whole thing is frankly overengineered for a personal website, but playing with transient web technologies is an indulgent hobby I don't want to relinquish. I started building it in late 2021 and tinker on it regularly.</p>

<h2>Technologies & Techniques</h2>
<p><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> does most of the heavy lifting – it's a static site builder that takes care of a lot of otherwise cumbersome optimisations like server-side rendering, image loading, and routing.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://styled-components.com/">styled components</a> to build and design the interface. All the individual notes and essays are written in <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a> – a souped-up version of markdown that makes it easy to design and reuse custom components and interactive JavaScript elements.</p>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> takes care of hosting. Animations are built with <a href="https://www.framer.com/api/motion/">Framer Motion</a>.</p>

<h2>Writing and Editing Content</h2>
<p>My CMS is just a bunch of flat files and folders. When I edit content on here I'm just typing text and syntax into MDX and JS files in VS Code. There's no fancy pipeline shuttling content directly from my personal knowledge management database (eg. <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a> or <a href="https://tana.ai/">Tana</a>). All my ideas start and marinate in my Tana, but I wait for them to mature a bit before they move over to this garden.</p>
<p>I know other people prefer setups where they can click one button and push content from personal notes to the web. I personally like having more control over how the material is displayed and laid out. Working directly in the native medium of the web – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – gives me fine-grained control. It allows me to play with typography, illustrations, graphic design, videos, animations, and interactive elements that pure text pipelines can't support. Text isn't the only way to represent ideas.</p>

<h2>Typography</h2>
<p>Headers are set in <a href="https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/canela">Canela Display</a> and body copy is set in <a href="https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/canela">Canela Text</a>, both from <a href="https://commercialtype.com/">Commercial Type</a>. I love its semi-serifs and classical feel. Supporting sans-serif type is set in <a href="https://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/">Lato</a>.</p>
<p>I use a <a href="https://utopia.fyi/">fluid type scale</a> developed by <a href="https://utopia.fyi/">Utopia</a>, which uses some wild CSS calculations to continuously adjust the font size relative to your browser's width.</p>
