# Automated Productivity

Automated productivity is a concept where an agent takes a human-described task and helps achieve it through a well-described environment. AI agents analyze tasks, assist in their execution, and facilitate seamless communication between humans, optimizing day-to-day productivity. This process involves agents scanning tasks, collaborating with human workers in an agent-free environment, and providing real-time updates on task outcomes on daily work routines.

## Working Alongside AI

Working alongside AI as a collaborator can be done in a number of ways:

- **Passive Assistance:** The agent can provide suggestions or recommendations as you work. For example, AI can be used to brainstorm ideas for articles, essays, or creative writing projects by suggesting words or phrases as you type.
- **Active (Hand-over) Assistance:** The agent can take over a task completely and then hand it back to you when it is finished. For instance, a voice assistant like Whisper, Descript, or Otter can transcribe a meeting for you in a separate application.

- **Embedded Assistance:** The agent can be embedded in a tool or application and provide assistance as you use it. For example, a feature like "Help Me Write" on Google Docs or Gmail can be used for word processing inside the application, and a tool like Cursor can help developers use AI directly into their workflow by offering code suggestions, helping in debugging, and providing code snippets for specific tasks.
